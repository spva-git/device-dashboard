## `/devices/${readingName}`
##### ENDPOINT
`/device/${readingName}?active=${stateValue}`

##### METHOD
`PATCH`

#### URL PARAMS
`active` - accepts true or false. `PATCH` here to toggle the `active` status for a specific reading.

##### NOTES
This endpoint is designed to imitate a "real world" async endpoint. The response times will vary, even on localhost, and occasionally your request will simply fail.
